Repository for Assignment 5


For the Designer Albert Nissim,
I have provided a basic website template. However, you could change it as you desire. A recommendation would be to use Kostin's Template.
Change the backgound picture to something thats fit the main topic of Pets.
Choose Fonts and pictures that go with the main topic of Pets.
Make sure the design for the ,Survey Login and Register pages are similar to the rest of the other webpages.



For the Coder Fiyin Oluyinka,
Code the Survey page to collect details from visitors to our website. Use bluehost database. 
Code the Login and Register pages.
Make sure once a user is logged out they do not have access to private area of the website.


Designer Notes: 

- Fonts have been updated to 'Open Sans' in the sans-serif font family. 
- Header image on each page was changed to a Jungle themed image that fits well into the green strip of background. 
- Each pet picture has been updated with new JPG images of a kitten, snake, and parrot
- Design is neat, unified, and organized. 
- There is use of the C.R.A.P. Principles we learned in class.
